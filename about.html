<p class="f5 lh-copy">
I’m Michał Łęcicki (aka Maikhel) - software engineer at Visuality.</br>
I believe self-improvement, responsibility and honest code are necessary to get things done.</br>
</p>

<div class="f4 b pv1 mv2 bb b--black-10"> My path </div>
<p class="f5 lh-copy">
My programming journey started in 2012 with free "Introduction to Java 101" Coursera course. Excited by power of creating a program that can rotate an image, I got to more serious learning at university. I finished with Bachelor’s degree in IT in 2016, University of Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński in Warsaw.</br>
</br>
In 2015, I started working in
<a href="https://www.weblify.pl/" title="weblify" target="_blank" class="link gray dim">Weblify</a>
as a junior Ruby on Rails developer and in 2018 I moved to
<a href="https://visuality.pl/" title="visuality" target="_blank" class="link gray dim">Visuality</a>
as a software engineer.
Surrounded by experienced engineers, I learned and still improve best development practices, applying clean architecture and using best design patterns.</br>
</br>
As a backend engineer I’m usually responsible for preparing Ruby on Rails API applications (currently in JSON:API standard), building software prototypes or creating third party integrations (eg. with Pipedrive). Doing devops stuff on Heroku or AWS also happens to me.
Few technologies I met so far include Elasticsearch, Terraform, Beskar, Serverless, R, Golang.</br>
</br>
In addition to blog posts, I made a Lightning talk about
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnz-y8sEBOk" target="_blank" title="Ruby on Rails & R" class="link gray dim">Ruby on Rails & R</a>.
</br>
Recently I'm taking a closer look at Golang and home automations (Hue API, Alexa).</br>

Primary field of my knowledge is psychology - I got psychology Master's Degree in 2015, University of Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński in Warsaw.</br>
Several psychology-related topics like stress management, cognitive psychology or productivity still fascinate me.</br>
I’m also devoted Getting Things Done methodology follower.</br>
</br>
More or less I speak English and German.</br>
</br>
In free time I play board games, hunt for perfect photo scene, read fantasy or just watch snooker.</br>
Oh, and I’m a big Star Wars fan.
