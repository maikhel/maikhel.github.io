    I’m Michał Łęcicki (aka Maikhel) - software engineer at Visuality.</br>
    I believe self-improvement, responsibility and clean solutions are necessary to get things done: both in software and real life.</br>

  <h3 class="f4 b pv1 mv2 bb b--black-30 dark--b--white-30"> My path </h3>
  <p class="lh-copy">
    My programming journey started in 2012 with free "Introduction to Java 101" Coursera course. Excited by creating a program that can rotate an image, I got to more serious learning at university. I finished with Bachelor’s degree in IT in 2016, University of Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński in Warsaw.
  </p>

  <p class="lh-copy">
    In 2015, I started working in
    <a href="https://www.weblify.pl/" title="weblify" target="_blank" class="link dark-blue dark--gold dim">Weblify</a>
    as a junior Ruby on Rails developer and in 2018 I moved to
    <a href="https://visuality.pl/" title="visuality" target="_blank" class="link dark-blue dark--gold dim">Visuality</a>
    as a software engineer.
    Surrounded by experienced engineers, I learned and still improve best development practices, applying clean architecture and choosing right design patterns.
  </p>

  <p class="lh-copy">
    As a backend engineer, I’m usually responsible for preparing Ruby on Rails API applications (currently in JSON:API standard), building software prototypes or creating third party integrations (eg. with Pipedrive). Doing devops stuff on Heroku or AWS also happens to me.
  Few technologies I met so far include Elasticsearch, Terraform, Beskar, Serverless, R, Golang.

  <p class="lh-copy">
    Recently, I'm taking a closer look at Domain Driven Design and Event Storming.
