  I'm Ruby on Rails developer, who seeks new technologies and more..
  And I'm huge fun of Getting Things done, especially connected to software engineering.

  Free time means playing board games, going for a walk to hunt a photo scene or just watch snooker.


  Typography has one plain duty before it and that is to convey information
  in writing. No argument or consideration can absolve typography from this
  duty. A printed work which cannot be read becomes a product without
  purpose.
