I'm a Ruby developer with over a decade of experience building and maintaining production Rails systems.

Over time, my focus shifted from writing code alone to thinking about ownership, responsibility, and how teams design, ship, and sustain software.

This site is where I write, collect talks, and share ideas I keep returning to.
