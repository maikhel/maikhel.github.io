I'm a Ruby developer with over a decade of experience building and maintaining production Rails systems.

Over time, my focus shifted from writing code alone to thinking about ownership and responsibility.
I help lead teams, plan feature releases and adapt to the new era of AI development.

This site is where I write, collect talks, and share ideas I keep returning to.
